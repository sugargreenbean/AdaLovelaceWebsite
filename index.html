								<h2>What is the Ada Lovelace Conference?</h2>
								<p>The Ada Lovelace Conference was born out of the desire to attend a conference full of hands on workshops, <br />
								a conference emphasizing hard skills in tech rather than soft skills. We believe that the "leaky pipeline" <br />
				 				needs knowledgable women sharing knowledge about code and technology. <br /> <br />
								Our goal is to provide an event for mid to senior level engineers to hone their skills. <br /> <br />
								We welcome anyone who identifies as female and allies to come create at the Ada Lovelace Conference.
